\section{Data Set and Data Preprocessing}
We choose two data sets to train Neural Network, including iris and wine-quality.The iris data set has 150 instances, 4 features and 3 categories. And the wine-quality data set has 4898 instances, 12 features, and 10 categories.

For each data set, we reshuffle the data set so that the model can learn more general features from it. And we divide data set into train set, validation set and test set by 80\%, 10\% and 10\%.
