\section{Conclusion}
We implement the fully connected Neural Network based on Python and numpy, and train and evaluate model on two data sets including iris and wine-quality. The model has one input layer, one output layer, and multiple hidden layers. We use \(softmax\) activator and cross entropy cost function to solve the muti-classification problems. The accuracies on two data set are both bigger than 90\%.

But there are also some limitations in the current model. We only use the fully connected layer. But when the numbers of neurons and features is much larger, the speed of calculations will be very slow. We can use convolutional neural network when the number of neurons are larger.

What's more, if the depth of hidden layer is larger, the problems of gradient vanishing and gradient exploding will be easier to occur. We can use drop out mechanism to avoid them, that is, the model drops out randomly some neurons at each batch training and only optimize weights of the rest neurons. When predicting target value, the model use all the neurons to calculate the output.
